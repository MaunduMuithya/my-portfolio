        <P>ABOUT ME:</P>
        <P>I was born and <span class="jug">in Nairobi.</span> I've lived in Bururburu since i was born. I attended two primary schools. First I attended Sherpherds Junior School from baby class to class 4 then I 
            joined Rockfields Junior school from class 5 to class 8 where I sat my KCPE examinations
            and managed 404 marks. I was the admitted to Moi Forces Academy from form 1
            to Form 2. I transferred and joined Rockfields Senior School where I sat my 
            KCSE and managed to score a B+. I decided to join Moringa school since
            I had an intrest in pursuing Computer Science in the University and needed a 
            prep progromme to introduce me into the field.
